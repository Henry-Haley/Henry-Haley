'''
Beginning work on a Web Server to host my tools and allow a GUI access to them, making it as simple as checking a box.
The plan is to use Flask for modular design and growth, in order to simply add tools as I use them. Hopefully I can start
to implement things like C2 Server capability down the line. The server itself is going to host things like reverse and bind
shells, scripts, and so on, while the web server will be able to interact with each and deploy as needed.
